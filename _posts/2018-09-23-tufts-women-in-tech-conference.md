The [Tufts Women in Tech Conference](https://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/3889){:target="_blank"} finally happened yesterday, and it was a smashing success! The rest of the team and I had worked over the summer to bring everything together, and it was wonderful to see everyone's work finally come to fruition. As a member of the Workshops Committee, I organized the POC Panel and the Product Management workshop; [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mTGGYpYO_7YPakZh9fv-S76eWgpSwou9/view){:target="_blank"} is the full schedule with the rest of the programming that was available. It was great to see so many women and nonbinary people get exposure to different sectors of tech and learn more about fields they were interested in - we even had some high schoolers from the Boston area attend! Earlier in the week, the WiT team painted the cannon in anticipation for the event, which was my first time participating in this classic Tufts tradition. All in all, I'm glad it went well and I can't wait for next year!
